<img src="/images/tjbot.jpg" width="85%">

[IBM Watson Maker Kits](http://ibm.biz/mytjbot) are a collection of DIY open source templates to connect to [Watson services](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/services-catalog.html) in a fun way. [IBM TJBot](http://ibm.biz/mytjbot) is the first kit in the collection.  

Currently, TJBot consists of a cardboard cutout (which can be 3D printed or laser cut), Raspberry Pi and a variety of add-ons â€“ including a RGB LED light, a microphone, a servo motor, and a camera. You can then use one of the available [recipes](recipes) to bring him to life!

Better still, you can create your own custom recipes to bring exciting ideas to life using any combination of Watson's Cognitive API's!

**TJBot will only run on the Raspberry Pi.**

# Get TJBot
To build out the bot, you can download the 3D print or laser cut design files from [ibm.biz/mytjbot](http://ibm.biz/mytjbot). If you already have a laser cut version of TJBot, this [detailed guide shows](http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-TJ-Bot-Out-of-Cardboard/) you how to fold it into a robot.



# Bring TJBot to life
[Recipes](recipes) are step by step instructions to help you connect your TJBot to [Watson services](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/services-catalog.html).
The [recipes](recipes) are designed based on a Raspberry Pi. You can either run one of the available [recipes](recipes) or create your own recipe that brings sweet ideas to life using any combination of [Watson API](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/services-catalog.html)!

We have provided the following [recipes](recipes)
- Speech to text
- Sentiment Analysis
- Conversation

# Contribute to TJBot
TJBot is open source and we'd love to see what you can make with him. Here are some ideas to get you started.

    - Visual recognition. TJBot has a placeholder behind his left eye to insert a Raspberry Pi camera. Try connecting the camera to the Watson Visual Recognition API so TJ can say hello when he sees you.

    - IoT. The Watson IoT service lets you control smart home devices (e.g. Philips Hue, LIFX lights, etc. ). Connect TJBot to IoT and have him control your home.

    - Connected robots. You can program multiple TJBots to send messages to each other using the Watson IoT platform.

If you have created your own recipe, we would love to include it as a [featured recipe](featured/README.md)! Just submit a pull request for your receipe instructions and code and send a link to a demo video to tjbot@us.ibm.com (Vimeo & YouTube preferred). We will review it and if we decide to include it in our repository, you'll be listed as the developer. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

We cannot wait to see what you build with [TJBot](http://ibm.biz/mytjbot)!

# About TJBot
[TJ](http://ibm.biz/mytjbot) is affectionately named after Thomas J. Watson, the first Chairman and CEO of IBM. TJBot was born at IBM Research as an experiment to find the best practices in the design and implementation of cognitive objects.
